This means that a dictionary is a set of key-value pairs. Note:

each key must be unique - it's not possible to have more than one key of the same value;
a key may be data of any type (except list): it may be a number (integer or float), or even a string;
a dictionary is not a list - a list contains a set of numbered values, while a dictionary holds pairs of values;
the len() function works for dictionaries, too - it returns the numbers of key-value elements in the dictionary;
a dictionary is a one-way tool - if you have an English-French dictionary, you can look for French equivalents of English terms, but not vice versa.

dictionary = {"cat" : "chat", "dog" : "chien", "horse" : "cheval"}
phone_numbers = {'boss' : 5551234567, 'Suzy' : 22657854310}
empty_dictionary = {}

print(dictionary)
print(phone_numbers)
print(empty_dictionary)

print(dictionary['cat'])
print(phone_numbers['Suzy'])

From 3.6 and beyond, dictionaries are in order. 


FOR LOOP:

dictionary = {"cat" : "chat", "dog" : "chien", "horse" : "cheval"}

for key in dictionary.keys():
    print(key, "->", dictionary[key]



dictionary = {"cat" : "chat", "dog" : "chien", "horse" : "cheval"}

for english, french in dictionary.items():
    print(english, "->", french)



dictionary = {"cat" : "chat", "dog" : "chien", "horse" : "cheval"}

for french in dictionary.values():
    print(french)




MODIFYING VALUES:
dictionary = {"cat" : "chat", "dog" : "chien", "horse" : "cheval"}

dictionary['cat'] = 'minou'
print(dictionary)



ADDING NEW KEY AND VALUES:
dictionary = {"cat" : "chat", "dog" : "chien", "horse" : "cheval"}

dictionary['swan'] = 'cygne'
print(dictionary)



REMOVING A KEY(WITH ITS VALUE):
dictionary = {"cat" : "chat", "dog" : "chien", "horse" : "cheval"}

del dictionary['dog']
print(dictionary)
