A tuple is an immutable sequence type. IT CAN'T BE CHANGE.

emptyTuple = ()

If you want to create a one-element tuple, 
you have to take into consideration the fact that, 
due to syntax reasons 
(a tuple has to be distinguishable from an ordinary, 
single value), you must end the value with a comma:

oneElementTuple1 = (1, )
oneElementTuple2 = 1., 

Removing the commas won't spoil the program in any 
syntactical sense, but you will instead get two single
variables, not tuples.






What else can tuples do for you?

the len() function accepts tuples, and returns the number of elements contained inside;
the + operator can join tuples together (we've shown you this already)
the * operator can multiply tuples, just like lists;
the in and not in operators work in the same way as in lists.

myTuple = (1, 10, 100)

t1 = myTuple + (1000, 10000)
t2 = myTuple * 3

print(len(t2))
print(t1)
print(t2)
print(10 in myTuple)
print(-10 not in myTuple)




Take a look at the snippet below:
var = 123

t1 = (1, )
t2 = (2, )
t3 = (3, var)

t1, t2, t3 = t2, t3, t1

print(t1, t2, t3)

It shows three tuples interacting - 
in effect, the values stored in them "circulate" - 
t1 becomes t2, t2 becomes t3, and t3 becomes t1.

Note: the example presents one more important 
fact: a tuple's elements can be variables, not only literals.
Moreover, they can be expressions if they're on the right 
side of the assignment operator.
