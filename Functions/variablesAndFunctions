# if there is an existed variable outside the function
- and that variable is called inside the function, it will take 
its value
- and that variable share its name with the same variable 
then the outside function will be ignored

#in order to change the value of outsider (variable) using 
a function. Use keyword "global". Note that it will only change 
if outsider is before the invocation of the function

# when using a list as a parameter
- only the value is being taken despite the outsider's name
